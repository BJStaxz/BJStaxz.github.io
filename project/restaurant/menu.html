                    A "Lightly Cured Kampachi" refers to a slice of raw 
                    Kampachi (also known as Hawaiian Yellowtail) fish that has 
                    been gently cured in a mixture of salt, sugar, and 
                    sometimes citrus, resulting in a subtly enhanced flavor 
                    with a slightly firmer texture, while still retaining its 
                    rich, buttery fat content and delicate taste, perfect for 
                    serving as crudo or in a sashimi dish; the "light" cure 
                    means the fish is not heavily seasoned, allowing its 
                    natural flavor to shine through.

                    Buttery mashed potatoes are rich and creamy, made by mashing 
                    boiled potatoes with butter, milk or cream, salt, and pepper
                    . The butter coats the potato's starch, resulting in a 
                    creamier texture.

                    on the outside, but are smooth on the inside. Rigatoni 
                    are perfect for big chunkier sauces as their ridges and 
                    wide center help capture the sauce perfectly.

                    Steak Tartare is a classic French dish consisting of finely 
                    minced raw beef, typically from a high-quality cut like 
                    tenderloin, mixed with seasonings like onions, capers, 
                    parsley, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and often topped 
                    with a raw egg yolk, served as a small appetizer or starter; 
                    it's considered a gourmet delicacy due to its reliance on 
                    fresh, high-quality ingredients and the potential risk 
                    associated with consuming raw meat.
