            <b>Crown Shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,
            <sup>[1]</sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i> <sup>[3]</sup> is a phenomenon observed 
            in some tree species, in which the crown of full stocked tree do 
            not touch each other, forming a canopy with change like gaps.
            <sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> the phenomenon is the most prevelant among 
            trees of the same species, but also occurs between tree of different 
            species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> there exist many hypothesis 
            as to why crown shyness is adaptive behavior , and research suggest 
            that might inhibit spread of the leaf eating larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            the exact physiological basis of crown is not certain <sup>[6]</sup>
            the phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literture since the 
            1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> the variety of hypothesis and expermental 
            results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across difference
            species, and example of convergent evolution.<sup>[citation needed]
