        <h2>THE PASTA</h2>

        <p>My favorite pasta to use for this is penne! However, you can really 
            use any pasta shape you like. Here are just some options I would go
             for:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>rigatoni</li>
            <li>cellatani</li>
            <li>rotoni</li>

        </ul>

        <h2><b>THE PUMPKIN SAUCE</b></h2>

        <p>If you are hesitant to try this recipe because you can only imagine 
            pumpkin puree in your pumpkin spice latte and not in pasta, think 
            again! I think I might like pumpkin in savory dishes over sweet ones
             now just because or this one recipe
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Here is everything you need for the sauce:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>unsalted butter</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>tomato paste</li>
