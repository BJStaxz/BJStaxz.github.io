                <p>
                    The WWE Royal Rumble is coming in hot and there’s hope for 
                    a lot of surprises. Fans want to see the women’s rumble, 
                    because there’s opportunity for several big names to return 
                    to the show. Speculation is that Charlotte Flair is one of 
                    those performers. That speculation also predicts that she’s 
                    going right back to the top of the women’s division with c
                    hampionship gold around her waist. If Flair does return, 
                    one must wonder where she stands and is best used on the 
                    main roster today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlotte Flair is a star. In all aspects of professional 
                    wrestling, Flair is a star. It does not matter what 
                    promotion she’d be in; she would still be booked as a top 
                    name in the women’s division. WWE has long positioned her 
                    at the top of the women’s division, even if that meant 
                    lowering other fan favorites along the way. So, no one 
                    should be surprised if someone’s momentum is cut because of 
                    Flair’s return.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                        Fightful Select recently reported that a WrestleMania 
                        match in sight pits Flair against new WWE Women’s 
                        Champion, Tiffany Stratton. While Stratton versus Flair 
                        has the allure of a main event contest, WWE must be 
                        careful with the outcome. Think back to when Asuka 
                        moved to the main roster after dominating WWE NXT. 
                        She’d win the Royal Rumble and face Flair at 
                        WrestleMania, only to lose. Some will argue that she 
                        never fully regained her momentum after that moment. 
                        While WWE’s booking at the time is to blame, the company 
                        does not want to make that same mistake with another 
                        young talent in Tiffany Stratton.

                <p>
                    The WWE Royal Rumble is only a few days away. Fans are 
                    speculating about what will happen, as it seems like the 
                    events are harder to predict than normal. The men's rumble 
                    feels especially big this year, as several of the top names
                    are announced for the match. One such individual is Roman 
                    Reigns. His inclusion in the battle royal makes everything 
                    even more important this year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Saturday, February 1, Roman Reigns will enter the Royal 
                    Rumble for the first time in five years. The last time he 
                    stepped into the match, he was the final person eliminated. 
                    Drew McIntyre tossed him over the ropes in a step to set up 
                    his run to the WWE Championship. But it was Reigns who has 
                    been the dominating force since, and the most important 
                    person on the WWE roster.
                </p>
                <h3></h3>
                <p>
                    Now, he doesn't have the WWE Undisputed Championship and 
                    he's on a quest to win it back. Should he be the favorite 
                    for the match? Depends on how you look at the rest of the 
                    field and the stories WWE is telling. But Reigns is 
                    certainly going to have several big moments on Saturday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every interaction that Reigns has in this match has the 
                    potential to lead to something big. Will he and CM Punk 
                    have a face-off moment? Who does Reigns eliminate and will 
                    they turn their focus to him? Who eliminates Reigns and 
                    gets the big momentum boost from that moment? Does he have 
                    a moment with a surprise entrant like Joe Hendry or Josh 
                    Alexander? WWE Creative have done such a great job building 
                    this Royal Rumble as a moment in which so many different 
                    things can happen, there is no way to predict how things 
                    will go down.
