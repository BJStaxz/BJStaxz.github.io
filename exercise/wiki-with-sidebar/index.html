                    World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is an American 
                    professional wrestling promotion. It is owned and operated 
                    by TKO Group Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary of 
                    Endeavor Group Holdings.[10] A global integrated media and 
                    entertainment company, WWE has also branched out into fields 
                    outside of wrestling, including film, football, and various 
                    other business ventures. The company is additionally 
                    involved in licensing its intellectual property to other 
                    companies to produce video games and action figures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The promotion was founded in 1953 as the Capitol Wrestling 
                    Corporation (CWC), a Northeastern territory of the National 
                    Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Following a dispute, CWC left the 
                    NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in 
                    April 1963. After rejoining the NWA in 1971, the WWWF was 
                    renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 before 
                    the promotion left the NWA for good in 1983. In 2002, 
                    following a legal dispute with the World Wildlife Fund, the 
                    WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). In 2011    
                    ,the promotion ceased branding itself as World Wrestling 
                    Entertainment and began solely branding itself with the 
                    initials WWE.[11]

                    Prior to September 2023, the company's majority owner was 
                    its executive chairman, third-generation wrestling promoter 
                    Vince McMahon, who retained a 38.6% ownership of the 
                    company's outstanding stock and 81.1% of the voting power. 
                    The current entity, which was originally named Titan Sports, 
                    Inc., was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in South 
                    Yarmouth, Massachusetts, but reincorporated under Delaware 
                    General Corporation Law in 1987. It acquired Capitol 
                    Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the WWF, 
                    in 1982. Titan was renamed World Wrestling Federation 
                    Entertainment, Inc. in 1999, and then World Wrestling 
                    Entertainment, Inc. in 2002. In 2023, its legal name was 
                    changed to World Wrestling Entertainment, LLC.[1]

                    WWE's origins can be traced back as far as the 1950s when 
                    on January 7, 1953, the first show under the Capitol 
                    Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was produced. There is 
                    uncertainty as to whom the founder of the CWC was. Some 
                    sources state that it was Vincent J. McMahon,[18][19][20] 
                    while other sources cite McMahon's father Jess McMahon as 
                    founder of CWC.[21][22][23] The CWC later joined the 
                    National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and famous New York 
                    promoter Toots Mondt soon joined the promotion.

                    entertainment. The fan base is referred to as the "WWE 
                    Universe" for the main roster shows, while for NXT shows, 
                    they are also referred to as the "NXT Universe". Main roster

                    On October 19, 1999, WWF, which had been owned previously 
                    by parent company Titan Sports, launched an initial public 
                    offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New 
                    York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then 
                    valued at $172.5 million.[45] The company traded on the NYSE 
                    under ticker symbol WWE.[46]

                    <br>

                    The company has actively marketed itself as a publicly 
                    traded company through presentations at investor conferences 
                    and other investor relations initiatives.[198] In June 2003, 
                    the company began paying a dividend on its shares of $0.04 
                    per share.[199] In June 2011, the company cut its dividend 
                    from $0.36 to $0.12.[200] In 2014, concerns about the 
                    company's viability caused wide fluctuations in its share 
                    price.[201]

                    In September 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings, UFC and WWE 
                    formed a new publicly traded company, TKO Group Holdings, 
                    Inc. The new entity went public on September 12, 2023 and 
                    is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the 
                    symbol "TKO".[202][203]
